# Implement Post-Review Fixes

Address the issues surfaced by the latest tasks review in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks-review-{latest-review-id}.md`.

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{latest-review-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan and review file was modified most recently.

Remember, you MUST follow the `@${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/ground-rules.md` at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
