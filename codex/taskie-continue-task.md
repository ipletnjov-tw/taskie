**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding, read and internalize all ground rules from `~/.codex/prompts/taskie-ground-rules.md`. You MUST follow these ground rules at ALL times throughout this task.


# Continue Task Implementation

You will need to continue working on a task in the implementation plan.

After you're done implementing it, document your progress with a short summary in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/task-{next-task-id}.md` and update the status and git commit hash of the subtask(s). Update the task status in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks.md`.

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{current-task-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan and task was modified most recently.

Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
