# Ground Rules

Read and follow the ground rules defined in `~/.codex/prompts/taskie-ground-rules.md`


# Implement Post-Tasks-Review Fixes

Address the issues surfaced by the latest tasks review in `.llm/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks-review-{latest-review-id}.md`

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{latest-review-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan and review file was modified most recently.

After you're done with your changes, update the task files and task list, and document your changes.

Remember, you MUST follow the ground rules above at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
