**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding, read and internalize all ground rules from `~/.codex/prompts/taskie-ground-rules.md`. You MUST follow these ground rules at ALL times throughout this task.

# Perform Task List Review

Perform a thorough review of the task list in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks.md` and all task files. Be very critical, look for mistakes, inconsistencies, misunderstandings, gaps in the task breakdown, over-engineering and other cruft.

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` is, use git history to find out which plan was modified most recently.

Document the results of your review in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks-review-{review-id}.md`.

Remember, you MUST follow the ground rules at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
