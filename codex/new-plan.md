# Create New Implementation Plan

You will need to create a new implementation plan according to the process, format and conventions defined in `.llm/ground-rules.md`.

The implementation plan MUST have its own subdirectory under `.llm/plans`.

The implementation plan MUST be written down into a Markdown file in the `.llm/plans/{current-plan-dir}`. The file MUST be titled `plan.md`.

The implementation plan file MUST contain the original prompt that was presented to you.

**DO NOT** add any timeline estimates (hours, days, weeks) to any part of the plan, task list, task files or subtasks. Also **DO NOT** add any dates or timestamps to any part of the plan or task list.

Remember, you MUST follow the `.llm/ground-rules.md` at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
