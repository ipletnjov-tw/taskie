**IMPORTANT:** Before proceeding, read and internalize all ground rules from `~/.codex/prompts/taskie-ground-rules.md`. You MUST follow these ground rules at ALL times throughout this task.


# Implement Post-Plan-Review Fixes

Address the issues surfaced by the latest plan review in `.taskie/plans/{current-plan-dir}/plan-{latest-review-id}.md`

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{latest-review-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan and review file was modified most recently.

After you're done with your changes, update the plan file and document your changes.

Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
