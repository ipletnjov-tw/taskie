# Implement Post-Review Fixes

Address the issues surfaced by the latest plan review in `.llm/plans/{current-plan-dir}/plan-review-{latest-review-id}.md`

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{latest-review-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan, task and review file was modified most recently.

Remember, you MUST follow the `.llm/ground-rules.md` at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
