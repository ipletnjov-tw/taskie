# Start Next Task Implementation

Proceed to the next task in the implementation plan.

After you're done implementing it, document your progress with a short summary in `.llm/plans/{current-plan-dir}/task-{next-task-id}.md` and update the status and git commit hash of the subtask(s). Update the task status in `.llm/plans/{current-plan-dir}/tasks.md`.

If you don't know what the `{current-plan-dir}` or `{next-task-id}` are, use git history to find out which plan and task was modified most recently.

Remember, you MUST follow the `.llm/ground-rules.md` at ALL times. Do NOT forget to push your changes to remote.
